# Seminars and Talks at Penn

There is a sometimes-belwidering array of relevant seminar series relevant to neuroscience, neuroimaging, psychiatry, and development.

We try to integrate these in a unified PennLINC google calender.  This is currently maintained by Sophia Linguiti, please contact her for access to this calendar if you a member of PennLINC.  The calendar is also mirrored for public viewing on the pennlinc.io frontpage (scroll to the bottom).

Several of the main seminar series are listed below:

### MINS

### MindCORE

### LiBI

### CBICA
